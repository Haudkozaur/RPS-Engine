# RPS-Engine

**RPS-Engine** is an interactive simulation of the classic *Rock–Paper–Scissors* game with physics-based collisions and real-time morphing between object types.
Icons move around the arena, collide, and transform according to RPS rules.
Thanks to its clear visualization and live scoreboard, decision-making becomes fast and intuitive.

## Features

* Realistic circle–circle collision physics.
* Automatic type morphing based on RPS rules.
* Live scoreboard and winner detection.
* Adjustable object count and size for performance tuning.
* Intuitive start screen and control panel.
